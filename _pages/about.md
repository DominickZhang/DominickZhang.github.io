Hi, I am a 2nd year PhD student in the Department of [Electrical and Computer Engineering Department](https://www.engr.wisc.edu/department/electrical-computer-engineering/) at [UW-Madison](https://www.wisc.edu/). It is my honor to be a member in Prof. [Varun Jog](https://sites.google.com/wisc.edu/vjog/) and Prof. [Po-Ling Loh](http://homepages.cae.wisc.edu/~loh/)'s group. I am also honored to be co-advised by Dr. [Alan McMillan](https://www.radiology.wisc.edu/profile/alan-mcmillan-313/), who is an associate professor in the Department of [Radiology](https://www.radiology.wisc.edu/). My current research interests include mathematical machine learning, deep learning, medical imaging, and computer vision.

I completed my Master of science in Beijing University of Posts and Telecommunications in 2017, where I was advised by Professor Zhiqiang He, Kai Niu, and [Yue Rong](http://ddfe.curtin.edu.au/yurong/) (Curtin University of Technology, Australia). My Master thesis was focused on carrier frequency offset(CFO) estimation and intereference cancellation of Non-orthogonal frequency division multiplexing(NOFDM). I also graduated with a Bachelor of engineering from Beijing Universiyt of Posts and Telecommunications in 2014.
