Hi, I am a 2nd year PhD student in the department of Electrical and Computer Engineering Department at UW-Madison. It is my honor to be a member in Prof. Varun Jog and Prof. Po-Ling Loh's group. I am also honored to be co-advised by Dr. Alan McMillan, who is an associate professor in the department of Radiology. My current research interests include mathematical machine learning, deep learning, medical imaging, and computer vision.
